**Hey there!**

My name is Fedor, I am ML engineer, playboy, my mom's pride, and very talented person.

Now doing my Master's degree at Peter the Great Saint Petersburg Polytechnic University in Biomedical Informational Systems and Technologies. The vast part of my free time I spend to do some code with machine learning applications. Also, I am trying to study Web development, but it is just a hobby at the moment.

Hope you enjoy my GitHub profile. Welcome!
