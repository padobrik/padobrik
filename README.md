## **Hey there!**

My name is Fedor, a programming enthusiast.

I am an MSc in Biomedical Computing from [Peter the Great Saint Petersburg Polytechnic University](https://english.spbstu.ru/) and am currently working as an ML Engineer and FullStack Web Developer at GrainFox. The vast part of my free time is dedicated to ML research, specifically in the areas of Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
